Write code that does the following in TypeScript:
- Declares 2 variables, length and width
- Calculates the perimeter of a rectangle, and prints it out (all the sides added together)
- Calculates the area of a rectangle, and prints it out (length x width)

Be sure to:
- Use types for your variables
- The values will NOT change, so use the correct way to declare them
- Add basic comments explaining your code

BONUS POINTS (try once you finish the above task)

You now have 3 variables, length, width, and height.
- Calculate the volume of the rectangle (length * width * height)
- Do research on how to calculate the TSA (Total Surface Area) of the object, and print it out
